# Registration-Form
This is an HTML code for a registration form which allows users to register for a website or service. 
The form includes several fields such as first name, last name, email address, password, account type (personal or business), 
profile picture upload, age, how the user heard about the website, and a bio.
The form also includes several validation rules such as making sure that the first name, last name, email address, 
and password fields are all filled out before the form can be submitted. 
The password field also has a pattern attribute, which requires the password to be at least 8 characters long and contain only 
lowercase letters and numbers. The age field has a minimum and maximum age limit of 13 and 120, respectively.
Additionally, the form includes a checkbox to accept the terms and conditions of the website, which is required to submit the form. 
Finally, when the user clicks the "Submit" button, the form data is sent to the URL specified in the "action" attribute of the "form" tag, 
which is https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org in this case.

There is also a CSS which styles the registration form HTML code. It sets the style for various elements such as the body, headings, form fields, 
input elements, and more. The CSS properties used in this code include width, height, margin, background-color, color, font-family, font-size, border, 
padding, display, min-width, text-align, and more. These properties are used to make the form visually appealing and user-friendly. 
For example, it sets the width and height of the body and form fields, adds background color, sets margins and padding, sets the font size and color, 
and more.
